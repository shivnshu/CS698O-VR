A computation graph is simply a specification of how your data is combined to give you the output. Since the graph totally specifies what parameters were involved with which operations, it contains enough information to compute derivatives. This probably sounds vague, so lets see what is going on using the fundamental class of Pytorch: ``autograd.Variable``.\n",

It has no idea that it was the sum of two other tensors (it could have been read in from a file, it could be the result of some other operation, etc.)\n",
